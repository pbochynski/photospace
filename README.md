## Setup & Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd photospace-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Azure App ID:**
    You need to create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add your Azure Application (Client) ID to it.

    Create the file `.env.local`:
    ```
    VITE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_AZURE_APP_CLIENT_ID_HERE"
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_AZURE_APP_CLIENT_ID_HERE` with the actual ID from your Azure App Registration.

    **Important:** In your Azure App Registration, under **Authentication**, make sure you have configured a **Single-page application (SPA)** platform with the redirect URI: `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite uses). You will need to add your final production URL (`https://photospace.app`) here as well.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Vite (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

5.  **Initial Setup:**
    - Grant permissions to access your OneDrive when prompted
    - The app will download AI models (~50MB) on first use
    - Models are cached locally for subsequent visits

  - Exact duplicates: 95-99%
  - Near duplicates: 90-95%
  - Similar shots: 85-90%
  - Loose grouping: 70-85%
- **Time Windows**:
  - Same photo session: 2-4 hours
  - Same day: 12-24 hours
  - All photos: 0 (disabled)
- **Series Detection**:
  - Burst sequences: 5+ photos/min, 2-3 min gap
  - Long sessions: 1-3 photos/min, 5-10 min gap
  - Time-lapse: 0.5-1 photos/min, 1-2 min gap

#### Best Practices
- **Backup Regularly**: Export embeddings after major processing sessions
- **Review Before Delete**: Check "best photo" selection before mass deletion
- **Use Date Filters**: Work through your library in manageable time periods
- **Browser Memory**: Clear database if it becomes too large (photos not affected)
- **URL Sharing**: Share URLs to return to specific folders or search results

## Deployment

### Automatic Deployment
This project includes a GitHub Action workflow to automatically build and deploy the application to GitHub Pages whenever you push to the `main` branch.
